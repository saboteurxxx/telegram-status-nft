## 📌 Overview

"Telegram Status NFT" is a user-driven trust and recognition system built for the **Telegram** and **TON blockchain** ecosystem. It introduces a **hierarchical status ladder** (11 levels + exclusive "Founder" status) that users can earn through verifiable community contribution.

Each status is represented by a **unique 3D NFT logo** featuring Telegram branding — not a medal, but a modern symbolic emblem. While **earning a status is free**, users may optionally **purchase official NFTs or stickers** to display it — only after verification of eligibility.

This system aims to:
- Encourage positive behavior and long-term engagement
- Create a new layer of **Telegram-native digital identity**
- Generate sustainable revenue for the TON ecosystem through NFT sales

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Clear progression ladder** — understandable for average users  
- ✅ **Status verification algorithm** — transparent and tamper-proof  
- ✅ **Exclusive 3D NFT designs** — with Telegram visual identity  
- ✅ **Purchase gated by status** — no NFT without earned eligibility  
- ✅ **Founder status** — single copy, granted by Pavel Durov’s choice
